# A mobile application called KodWork 
This repository presents an example of job application taught by [Kodluyoruz]{https://www.kodluyoruz.org/}

The app is implemented by using **react-native**. We use **Axios** to pull the information of products retrieved from [https://www.themuse.com/developers/api/v2]{https://www.themuse.com/developers/api/v2}. Furthuremore, we benefited from **Lottie** component to create loading and error animations.

We performed **react-navigation** in order to manage stack and drawer structure of the mobile app.

We implemented **react-redux** so as to handle global variable while creating favorite jobs.
